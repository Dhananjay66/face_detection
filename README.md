Face Detection, Age & Gender Prediction with Speech Recognition
This project implements real-time face detection, age & gender prediction, and speech recognition using OpenCV, deep learning models, and Google Speech Recognition.

Features
‚úÖ Face Detection using OpenCV DNN and Haar Cascades

‚úÖ Age & Gender Prediction using pre-trained models

‚úÖ Real-time Speech Recognition (converts speech to text)

‚úÖ Live Webcam Processing


Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages
Run the following command:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy speechrecognition pyaudio
‚ö† If pyaudio installation fails, install it manually:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Dhananjay66/face_detection.git
cd face_detection
3Ô∏è‚É£ Download Pre-trained Models
Place the following files in the project folder:

deploy.prototxt

res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel

age_deploy.prototxt

age_net.caffemodel

gender_deploy.prototxt

gender_net.caffemodel

Usage
Run the script to start the application:

sh
Copy
Edit
python facedetection.py
Controls
üîπ Press "q" to exit the program

How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ Face Detection:

Uses OpenCV DNN model to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Age & Gender Prediction:

Extracts the detected face and predicts age & gender using deep learning models.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Speech Recognition:

Continuously listens for voice input and converts speech to text, saving it in speech_output.txt.

Demo

Troubleshooting
üö® Error: No module named 'pyaudio'
üëâ Run the following:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
üö® Camera Not Opening?
üëâ Ensure your webcam is working and available.
